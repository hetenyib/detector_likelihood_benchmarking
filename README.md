# Detector likelihood benchmarking
Notebooks and scripts used in the manuscript "Using Detector Likelihood for Benchmarking Quantum Error Correction"  https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02082

The manuscript presents the analysis of quantum memory experiments based on the experimentally measured detector likelihood for the Floquet code and the 3-CX code.

For the Floquet code:
- folder "runs" contains all the data presented in the manuscript
- folder "src" contains the scripts for the data analysis
- folder "simulation_data" includes the simulated data
- the analysis and plotting is performed in the notebooks "data_processing.ipynb" and "paper_image_generation_Floquet.ipynb" 

For the 3CX code:
- folder "data_3CX" contains all the data presented in the manuscript
- folder "simulations_3CX" includes the simulated data
- the analysis and plotting is performed in the notebook "run_decode_plot_3CX.ipynb"
